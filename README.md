# SVG Logo Generator
  
  ## Description

The SVG logo generator aims to create an svg file based on user inputs. This is done by allowing the user to set the text, colors, and shape. By having the inquirer package, it allows the user to receive a terminal prompt to enter in the variables to be used. Each prompt is validated to generate the corresponding output. The options from each input are taken and used as internal variables to set different properties. This will allow the program to generate an SVG file with those specifications. Test cases were run and added in the test JS file done through jest to validate functions and outputs. Overall the app aims to add functionality to generate simple logos.
